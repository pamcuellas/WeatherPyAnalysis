# Weather Python Analysis
The purpose of this project was built a Python script basically to awswer the question: What's the weather like as we approach the equator?
So, making use of Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals, a data set with 500 cities was selected randomly from the 
<a href="https://openweathermap.org/api" target="_blank">OpenWeatherMap API</a> and a series of scatter plots were created to showcase the following realtionships:
<br><br>
Temperature (F) vs. Latitude<br>
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude<br>
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude<br>
And Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
<br><br>
The Jupyter Notebook built to accomplish this analysis can be visualized <a href="https://pamcuellas.github.io/assets/images/weather-python-analysis.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
